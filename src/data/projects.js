    description: `Welcome to a pawsitively exciting project! <br/> The goal was to create a completely sustainable brand identity and packaging design for a business close to my heart—our furry friends! <br/> This 100% dog-friendly and edible packaging design made from potato starch. Yes, you read that right—your pup can munch on it! This packaging is all about saying goodbye to single-use plastics and embracing a zero-waste lifestyle. It can be eaten or composted, making mealtime a fun and eco-friendly experience for both dogs and their humans. <br/> This project encourages dog owners to explore playful alternatives for their pets’ food packaging, proving that sustainability can be just as delightful as a wagging tail! <br/> So let’s treat our pups, and the planet, with love and creativity! `,
